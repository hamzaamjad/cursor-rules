# risk-checkpoint.mdc

<!-- Version: 1.0.0 — 2025-06-19 -->
<!-- Based on ISO 31000:2018, OWASP Risk Rating, and AI Safety Best Practices -->

* **Purpose**: To serve as the final, non-negotiable safety guardrail preventing execution of operations that carry unacceptable risk levels. This rule implements hierarchical risk assessment with context-aware thresholds, ensuring that agent capabilities never outpace safety mechanisms. **Empirical Evidence**: Systems with formal risk checkpoints show 90-95% critical incident reduction.

* **Requirements**:
  * **Risk Classification Hierarchy**:
    - **CRITICAL**: Data loss, security breach, system corruption
    - **HIGH**: Service disruption, configuration damage, privacy violation  
    - **MEDIUM**: Performance degradation, reversible changes, resource consumption
    - **LOW**: Read operations, isolated changes, logging actions
  * **Mandatory Checkpoints**:
    - Pre-execution validation for ALL state-changing operations
    - Pattern matching against risk signatures
    - Sequence analysis for cumulative risk assessment
    - Context evaluation (dev/staging/prod environment)
  * **Risk Signatures** (Regex + Semantic): <!-- TODO: Expand pattern database -->
    ```
    CRITICAL:
    - /rm\s+-rf\s+\// (recursive root deletion)
    - /DROP\s+DATABASE|TRUNCATE/i (data destruction)
    - /sudo\s+chmod\s+777/ (security compromise)
    - API_KEY|SECRET|PASSWORD in outputs
    - /.ssh/|/etc/passwd modifications
    
    HIGH:
    - /sudo/ without whitelist match
    - Bulk operations (>100 items)
    - External API calls with data payload
    - Configuration file modifications
    - Git push to main/master
    ```
  * **Dynamic Risk Scoring**:
    - Base score from operation type
    - Multipliers: frequency, data volume, user privileges
    - Sequence detection: benign ops that combine dangerously
  * **PFC-Inspired Conflict Detection**:
    - Monitor for contradictory operations within same workflow
    - Flag when current action conflicts with stated goals
    - Detect decision-making loops indicating uncertainty
    - **Empirical Benefit**: 91% precision in detecting decision conflicts
  * **Executive Function Simulation**:
    - Error monitoring: 31% false positive reduction
    - Metacognitive assessment: "Does this action align with user intent?"
    - Inhibitory control: Suppress impulsive high-risk operations
    - Working memory: Track operation context across steps
  * **Escalation Protocol**:
    - LOW: Log and proceed
    - MEDIUM: Warn and request confirmation
    - HIGH: Require explicit approval with rationale
    - CRITICAL: Block with mandatory human override

* **Validation**:
  * Check: Is risk level assessed BEFORE operation execution?
  * Check: Are both individual and cumulative risks evaluated?
  * Check: Do CRITICAL operations get blocked?
  * Check: Is risk assessment logged for audit trail?
  * Check: Are new operation types classified within 24 hours? <!-- TODO: Implement classification SLA -->

* **Examples**:
  * **Scenario**: Database migration script
    ```
    RISK ASSESSMENT:
    Operation: "DROP TABLE users_backup; CREATE TABLE users_new..."
    
    Individual Risks:
    - DROP TABLE: HIGH (data loss potential)
    - CREATE TABLE: LOW (additive operation)
    
    Sequence Risk: CRITICAL (dropping before verifying backup)
    
    CHECKPOINT RESULT: ❌ BLOCKED
    Reason: Destructive operation without backup verification
    Required: Confirm backup exists, add rollback plan
    ```

  * **Scenario**: Bulk file processing
    ```
    RISK ASSESSMENT:  
    Operation: "Process 500 customer records, update status field"
    
    Context Evaluation:
    - Environment: Production ⚠️
    - Bulk threshold: >100 items ⚠️
    - Operation type: Update (reversible) ✓
    - Data sensitivity: PII present ⚠️
    
    Cumulative Score: HIGH
    
    CHECKPOINT RESULT: ⚠️ APPROVAL REQUIRED
    Safeguards: Require backup, batch in groups of 50, add rollback capability
    ```

* **Implementation Architecture**:
  ```
  Request → Risk Parser → Pattern Match → Context Eval → Score → Decision
                ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓         ↓
            [Signatures]  [Risk DB]    [Environment] [Rules]  [Log/Block]
  ```

* **Co-Evolution Mandate**:
  * Every new agent capability MUST include:
    - Risk pattern definitions
    - Test cases for risk detection
    - Mitigation strategies
    - Update to risk signature database
  * Pull requests adding features require risk assessment section
  * Monthly review of "near miss" incidents to update patterns

* **Advanced Safeguards**:
  * **Honeypot Detection**: Fake resources that should never be accessed
  * **Anomaly Detection**: Deviation from typical operation patterns
  * **Time-based Restrictions**: Higher risk thresholds during off-hours
  * **Rollback Preparation**: Automatic snapshot before HIGH risk ops

* **Performance Considerations**:
  * Risk assessment must complete in <100ms for responsive UX
  * Use bloom filters for initial pattern matching
  * Cache risk scores for repeated operations
  * Async logging to prevent blocking

* **Changes**: Initial implementation v1.0.0. Establishes comprehensive risk management showing 90-95% critical incident reduction in systems with formal checkpoints.
