# No Version Bloat Rule

* **Purpose**: Maintain clean architecture by preventing creation of duplicate "enhanced", "v2", or "_new" versions of existing files. **Empirical Impact**: Projects with version bloat show 45% higher maintenance costs and 3x longer onboarding time.
* **Principle**: Integrate improvements into existing files rather than creating parallel versions.
* **Requirements**:
  1. **Before Creating New Files**: Check if functionality belongs in existing file
  2. **Naming Convention**: Never use suffixes like "_enhanced", "_v2", "_new", "_improved"
  3. **Consolidation First**: If prototyping created temporary versions, consolidate immediately
  4. **Git Strategy**: Use branches for experimental features, not duplicate files
  5. **Stigmergic Version Tracking**: Leave evolution markers in files:
     ```python
     # EVOLUTION_TRAIL: basic_impl.v1 -> optimized.v2 -> current
     # DEPRECATED_FEATURES: old_method (removed 2025-01-02)
     # ENHANCEMENT_MARKER: Added caching support - 30% faster
     ```
  6. **Version Decay Pattern**: Temporary files auto-expire after 7 days:
     ```python
     # TEMPORARY_FILE: expires 2025-01-09
     # PURPOSE: Testing new algorithm approach
     # MERGE_TARGET: main_module.py
     ```
* **Validation**:
  * Check: Are there any duplicate versions of core files?
  * Check: Do new features extend existing infrastructure?
  * Check: Is the codebase free of abandoned prototype files?
* **Examples**:
  * ❌ BAD: Creating `safir_enhanced.py` alongside `safir.py`
  * ✅ GOOD: Adding enhanced methods to existing `safir.py`
  * ❌ BAD: `llm_service_v2.py` for new features
  * ✅ GOOD: Extending `llm_service.py` with new capabilities
* **Exceptions**: 
  * Temporary test files during development (must be cleaned up)
  * True architectural rewrites requiring parallel development
* **Enforcement**: Review file additions for version suffixes before committing
