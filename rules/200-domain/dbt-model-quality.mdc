# dbt-model-quality

*Purpose*: Maintain high standards for dbt models.

- Every model requires `description` in YAML and column-level docs.
- Write `tests:` for uniqueness, non-null, relationships.
- Use incremental vs. full-refresh appropriately; document rationale.
- Optimize model SQL for performance (avoid cross-joins, excessive CTEs).
