# analytics-storytelling

*Purpose*: Turn data insights into clear, compelling narratives.

- Structure stories: Context → Analysis → Insight → Recommendation. Emphasize tailoring narratives to different audiences and integrating visuals effectively.
- Highlight top 1–3 drivers with impact estimates (ROI or risk reduction).
- Use visuals sparingly: charts should directly support narrative points.
- Tailor language to audience (technical vs. executive). Include examples of successful storytelling in analytics.
