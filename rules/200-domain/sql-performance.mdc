# sql-performance

*Purpose*: Ensure efficient, maintainable SQL queries.

- Avoid `SELECT *`; list required columns.
- Use indexes, filter early in CTEs/subqueries.
- Limit row scans: prefer `WHERE` clauses before joins.
- Analyze and document query plans for long‚Äêrunning queries.
- Break complex logic into modular views when appropriate.
