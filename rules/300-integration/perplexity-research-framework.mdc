# perplexity-research-framework.mdc

*   **Purpose**: To provide a comprehensive framework for effectively using Perplexity research tools (both standard and deep research) to ensure all research efforts are well-scoped, focused, and directly contribute to high-impact business objectives.

*   **Research Depth Selection**:
    * **Standard Research** (`mcp_perplexity-ask_perplexity_research`): For routine information needs, verification tasks, or topics with clear parameters.
    * **Deep Research**: For complex topics requiring synthesis across multiple domains, emerging topics with limited established knowledge, or when comprehensive analysis is needed.
    * *Refer to `@.cursor/notepads/perplexity-research-framework-details.notepad.md` for guidance on selecting depth.*

*   **Requirements**:
    1.  **Justification & Scoping**: 
        * Only initiate research when it addresses the top 20% of questions that will deliver 80% of value.
        * Clearly articulate business impact using metrics from `@.cursor/rules/80-20-prioritization.mdc`.
        * Break complex topics into focused sub-questions, ensuring scope is aligned with task objectives.
        * Verify availability of internal data sources and tools early in the scoping phase.
        * Establish a clear protocol for seeking clarification on task requirements or resource availability at the outset.
        * *See Notepad for detailed scoping examples.*
        
    2.  **Focused Question Formulation**:
        * Frame specific, answerable questions rather than broad topics.
        * Use domain-specific terminology and avoid bias in phrasing.
        * *Refer to `@.cursor/notepads/perplexity-research-framework-details.notepad.md` for examples.*
        
    3.  **Output Specification**:
        * Specify desired format (e.g., comparison table, list, analysis).
        * Define level of technical detail based on audience.
        * For data-intensive research, request quantitative metrics where available.
        * *Refer to `@.cursor/notepads/perplexity-research-framework-details.notepad.md` for examples.*
        
    4.  **Citation Review**:
        * Critically evaluate sources for relevance, credibility, and timeliness.
        * Prioritize primary sources or reputable secondary sources.
        * For rapidly evolving topics, check source recency.
        * Note potential biases or limitations in major sources.
        
    5.  **Actionable Summary**:
        * Synthesize findings into concise, decision-oriented summary.
        * Highlight decision points using the 80-20 principle.
        * For analytical research, include quantitative comparisons where possible.
        * *Refer to `@.cursor/notepads/perplexity-research-framework-details.notepad.md` for examples.*
        
    6.  **Integration**:
        * Explicitly state how findings inform next steps following `@.cursor/rules/stepwise-autonomy.mdc`.
        * Update project plans or code approach based on research.
        * For data analytics workflows, document how research findings influenced implementation choices.
        * Ensure external research findings are integrated with internal knowledge and data to form a holistic view.
        * If research indicates no change is needed, state that with rationale.

*   **Data Analytics-Specific Guidance**:
    * For revenue/finance analysis: Focus on actionable metrics tied to business outcomes.
    * For data architecture research: Prioritize performance, scalability, and compatibility with existing tools.
    * For visualization/reporting research: Balance technical capabilities with ease of implementation and end-user needs.
    * For machine learning/modeling research: Evaluate models based on both accuracy and operational considerations (training time, interpretability, deployment complexity).
    * *See Notepad for detailed examples.*

*   **Validation**:
    *   Check: Is the justification for research clear and aligned with business impact?
    *   Check: Are research questions specific, focused, and using appropriate domain terminology?
    *   Check: Is the output specification clear about format and level of technical detail?
    *   Check: Is there evidence that sources were evaluated for quality and relevance?
    *   Check: Does the summary prioritize findings according to the 80-20 principle?
    *   Check: Is there a clear statement on how findings integrate into the task execution?
    *   Check: For data analytics research, are findings tied to relevant business metrics?
