# Advanced Agent Patterns

## Multi-File Operations

```python
# Atomic multi-file changes
changes = {
    'src/api.py': [...edits...],
    'tests/test_api.py': [...edits...],
    'docs/api.md': [...edits...]
}

with atomic_operation():
    for path, edits in changes.items():
        apply_edits(path, edits)
    run_tests()  # Rollback all if fails
```

## AST-Based Refactoring

```python
# Safe function rename across codebase
ast_tree = parse_codebase(['*.py'])
references = find_all_references('old_function')
for ref in references:
    edit_block(ref.file, ref.line, 'new_function')
```

## Parallel Processing

| Pattern | Use Case | Max Concurrent |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Read-only analysis | Search/lint | CPU count |
| File writes | Independent files | 4-8 |
| Test execution | Unit tests | CPU count |
| Git operations | Commits | 1 (serial) |

## Performance Optimization
- Batch similar operations
- Cache file reads
- Use incremental parsing
- Profile before optimizing
