# Cursor Agent Core

**Purpose**: Reliable autonomous codebase changes.

## Essential Workflow

```python
# 1. Read → 2. Plan → 3. Apply → 4. Verify
content = read_file(path)
changes = analyze_modifications(content)
apply_with_verification(path, changes)
run_terminal_cmd("pytest")
```

## Tool Priority

| Operation | Primary | Fallback |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Surgical edit | `edit_block` | `edit_file` |
| Full rewrite | `write_file` | Manual chunks |
| Multi-file | Batch operations | Sequential |

## Safety Rules
1. Always read before edit
2. Verify after every change
3. Rollback on validation failure
4. Test before claiming success

## Quick Patterns
- **Rename**: Find all → Edit each → Verify
- **Refactor**: AST analysis → Staged edits
- **Migrate**: Backup → Transform → Validate
