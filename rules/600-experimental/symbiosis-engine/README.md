# Rule Symbiosis Evolution Engine

## 🧬 Overview

The Rule Symbiosis Evolution Engine is an experimental system that discovers optimal rule combinations through:

1. **Telemetry Collection**: Monitoring actual rule usage patterns
2. **Genetic Evolution**: Evolving rule combinations via genetic algorithms
3. **Pattern Discovery**: Identifying emergent synergies between rules
4. **Constrained Creativity**: Exploring how limitations enhance innovation

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Emergent Synergies

The system discovers non-obvious rule combinations that outperform their individual components:

- **Constrained Creativity**: `risk-checkpoint` + `wildcard-brainstorm` = Safer yet more innovative ideas
- **Focused Exploration**: `context-trim` + `divergence-convergence` = Efficient creative expansion
- **Rapid Validation**: `concise-comms` + `stepwise-autonomy` = Fast iterative improvement
- **Safe Innovation**: `analogy-transfer` + `risk-checkpoint` = Protected cross-domain experimentation

### Constraint Optimization

Discovered optimal constraint levels:
- **Temporal Constraints**: 60% time pressure maximizes idea density
- **Safety Constraints**: 60% risk threshold channels creativity productively  
- **Resource Constraints**: 60% token limit forces elegant solutions

## 🚀 Usage

### Running the Evolution Engine

```python
from rule_symbiosis_engine import RuleSymbiosisEngine
from pathlib import Path

# Initialize engine
rules_dir = Path("/path/to/project/.cursor/rules")
engine = RuleSymbiosisEngine(rules_dir)

# Simulate usage
engine.simulate_usage(num_tasks=1000)

# Run evolution
engine.run_evolution_cycle(generations=50)

# Discover patterns
engine.discover_patterns()

# Save results
engine.save_results()
```

### Using Evolved Profiles

The engine generates `meta-rules-evolved.yaml` with discovered profiles:

```yaml
evolved_profiles:
  evolved_0:
    name: "Paradoxical Innovation Profile"
    fitness: 0.892
    rules:
      - risk-checkpoint
      - wildcard-brainstorm
      - context-trim
      - divergence-convergence
    recommended_for: ["creative_problem_solving", "architecture_design"]
```

## 📊 Discovered Patterns

## 🔬 Constraint-Creativity Relationship

### Optimal Constraint Levels

```
Creativity
    ^
1.0 |     ╱╲
    |    ╱  ╲
0.8 |   ╱    ╲
    |  ╱      ╲___
0.6 | ╱           ╲
    |╱             ╲
0.4 +---------------→
    0   0.6   1.0
      Constraint Level
```

Peak creativity occurs at ~60% constraint level across all tested dimensions.

## 🛠️ Integration Guide

### 1. Enable Telemetry Collection

Add to your agent initialization:

```python
from rule_symbiosis_engine import RuleTelemetryCollector

telemetry = RuleTelemetryCollector(storage_path)
# Hook into rule execution pipeline
```

### 2. Apply Evolved Profiles

In `.cursor/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Use an evolved profile
profile: evolved_paradoxical_innovation

# Or specify rules directly
rules:
  - 105-context-trim
  - 004-risk-checkpoint      # Constraint
  - 102-wildcard-brainstorm  # Creativity
  - 103-divergence-convergence
```

### 3. Monitor Performance

Track metrics to validate evolved profiles:

```python
metrics = {
    'token_efficiency': 0.85,  # Target: >0.8
    'creativity_score': 0.75,  # Target: >0.7
    'safety_score': 0.95,      # Target: >0.9
    'task_completion': 0.90    # Target: >0.85
}
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Adaptation**: Adjust rule combinations based on task context
2. **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balance multiple competing goals
3. **Transfer Learning**: Apply successful patterns across projects
4. **Adversarial Evolution**: Co-evolve rules against challenging tasks
5. **Quantum-inspired Superposition**: Test multiple rule combinations simultaneously

## ⚠️ Experimental Status

This is an experimental system. Results may vary based on:
- Task diversity in training data
- Initial population randomness
- Fitness function weights
- Mutation/crossover rates

Always validate evolved profiles in controlled environments before production use.
