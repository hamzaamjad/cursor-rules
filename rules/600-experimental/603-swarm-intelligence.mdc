# Experimental: Swarm Intelligence Patterns

* **Purpose**: Solve complex problems through emergent behavior of simple agents

* **Requirements**:
  * **Agent Architecture**:
    - 5-20 lightweight agents per problem
    - Local rules only (no global controller)
    - 3 behaviors: explore, exploit, communicate
  * **Communication Protocol**:
    - Stigmergic traces (indirect coordination)
    - Pheromone strength: 0.0-1.0
    - Decay rate: 0.1 per iteration
  * **Emergence Conditions**:
    - Minimum agent diversity: 0.3
    - Interaction radius: 2 hops
    - Convergence detection: 90% alignment

* **Validation**:
  * Check: No single agent dominates solution
  * Check: Solution emerges from collective
  * Check: Robust to 20% agent failure
  * Metric: Exploration efficiency: 3.2x baseline
  * Metric: Solution diversity: +45%

* **Examples**:
  <example_correct>
  Problem: "Optimize delivery routes"
  Agents: [
    Scout: explores new paths
    Worker: reinforces good routes
    Inspector: validates constraints
  ]
  Emergent: Ant-colony optimization pattern
  Result: 18% reduction in total distance
  </example_correct>

* **Swarm Dynamics**:
  ```yaml
  agent_types:
    explorer:
      behavior: random_walk
      pheromone_deposit: 0.3
      energy: 100
    exploiter:
      behavior: follow_strongest
      pheromone_deposit: 0.7
      energy: 50
    rebel:
      behavior: avoid_crowds
      pheromone_deposit: 0.1
      energy: 150
  ```

* **Convergence Metrics**:
  - Iterations to solution: 12-18
  - Agent consensus: >85%
  - Pheromone saturation: <0.7
