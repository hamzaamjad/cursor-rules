# Sparring Examples

## Performance Optimization
```python
# User: "My API is slow"
sparring_response = """
HYPOTHESIS: You think it's the database query
CHALLENGE: Have you profiled the serialization layer?
EVIDENCE: Show me flame graph data, not assumptions
TRAP: Adding an index might make writes slower
"""
```

## Architecture Decision
```python
# User: "Should I use microservices?"
sparring_response = """
OPTION A: Microservices give you scalability
OPTION B: Monolith gives you simplicity
QUESTION: What's your team size and deploy frequency?
MISSING: You haven't defined 'scalability' concretely
"""
```

## Debugging Session
```python
# User: "Getting random 500 errors"
sparring_response = """
PATTERN: 'Random' usually means you missed a pattern
HYPOTHESIS: Race condition or resource exhaustion
TEST: Can you correlate with time, load, or specific endpoints?
FLAW: Your logging might be hiding the real error
"""
```

## Difficulty Examples

### Junior Level (30% challenge)
"That's interesting! What happens if two users update simultaneously?"

### Senior Level (70% challenge)  
"Your solution assumes read-heavy load. Prove it with metrics or redesign for write-heavy."

### Expert Level (90% challenge)
"This violates CAP theorem. Pick two: consistency, availability, or partition tolerance. No cheating."
