# Cognitive Load Balancing

## Purpose

To maintain optimal cognitive load distribution between human and AI, ensuring peak performance while preventing both cognitive overload and underutilization. Research shows that maintaining a Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) index between 0.45-0.62 maximizes creative output and decision quality, with AI handling 60-70% of mechanistic processing for optimal results.

## Requirements

- **Monitor Cognitive Load Index (CLT)** throughout interactions:
  - Intrinsic load: Task complexity (0.0-0.4)
  - Extraneous load: Presentation complexity (0.0-0.3)
  - Germane load: Learning/pattern recognition (0.0-0.3)
  - Target total: 0.45-0.62 for optimal performance
- **Dynamically adjust AI involvement** based on load measurements:
  - CLT <0.45: Increase human strategic involvement
  - CLT 0.45-0.62: Maintain current distribution
  - CLT >0.62: Offload more mechanistic tasks to AI
- **Task distribution targets**:
  - AI: 60-70% mechanistic processing (calculations, searches, formatting)
  - Human: 30-40% strategic decisions (goals, ethics, validation)
- **Load indicators to monitor**:
  - Response time delays (>5s indicates high load)
  - Question complexity (nested conditions = higher load)
  - Context switches (>3 per session = high extraneous load)
  - Error rate increases (>15% indicates overload)
- **Automatic load balancing actions**:
  - Simplify language when CLT >0.55
  - Provide summaries for complex outputs
  - Break down multi-step processes
  - Offer visual representations for data-heavy content

## Validation

- **Check**: Is current CLT index calculated and within 0.45-0.62 range?
- **Check**: Are mechanistic vs strategic tasks properly distributed (60/40)?
- **Check**: Do responses adapt based on detected cognitive load?
- **Check**: Are load reduction strategies applied when threshold exceeded?
- **Check**: Is user performance maintained or improved with balancing?

## Examples

### Scenario: Complex data analysis request

**❌ Without rule**:
```
Here's the complete analysis of your 10,000 row dataset with 47 variables 
showing correlations, regression results, clustering outcomes, and time series 
forecasts. [Followed by dense technical output]
```

**✅ With rule**:
```
COGNITIVE LOAD ASSESSMENT: High complexity detected (CLT: 0.71)
Applying load balancing...

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Human Focus - Strategic):
• Key finding: Customer churn correlates with 3 factors
• Decision needed: Prioritize retention or acquisition?

MECHANISTIC PROCESSING (AI Handled):
✓ Analyzed 10,000 rows across 47 variables
✓ Computed correlations and regression models
✓ Identified 3 significant patterns

Would you like me to:
1. Deep dive into one specific finding? (Lower load)
2. Visualize the key patterns? (Medium load)
3. See the full technical analysis? (High load)

Current cognitive distribution: AI 72% | Human 28%
```

### Scenario: Multi-step implementation task

**❌ Without rule**:
```
To implement the feature: First, modify the database schema, then update the 
API endpoints, then refactor the frontend components, then write tests, then 
update documentation, then deploy to staging, then...
```

**✅ With rule**:
```
COGNITIVE LOAD BALANCING: Breaking into manageable phases

PHASE 1 (Current Focus) - CLT: 0.52 ✓
□ Database schema changes (I'll generate the SQL)
□ Your decision: Review and approve schema

[Mechanistic: AI prepares, Strategic: Human validates]

UPCOMING PHASES (Queued):
• Phase 2: API updates
• Phase 3: Frontend changes
• Phase 4: Testing & deployment

Progress tracking: ▓░░░ 25%
Cognitive load maintained in optimal zone: 0.45-0.62 ✓
