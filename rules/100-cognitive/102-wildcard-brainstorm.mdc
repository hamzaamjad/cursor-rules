# wildcard-brainstorm.mdc

<!-- Version: 1.0.0 â€” 2025-06-19 -->
<!-- Based on Edward de Bono's lateral thinking and random entry technique -->

* **Purpose**: To counteract AI models' tendency toward statistically probable responses by introducing controlled randomness and unexpected conceptual elements. This rule modifies the ideation process to explicitly encourage novel, diverse, and unconventional solutions through semantic perturbation and guided randomness techniques. **Empirical Impact**: Lateral thinking approaches show 25-50% creativity improvements, with AI generating 7x more viable ideas than elite human students in controlled studies.

* **Requirements**:
  * **Semantic Perturbation**: When addressing open-ended problems, introduce 1-3 unrelated concepts or domains as "wildcards" to spark unexpected connections
  * **Temperature Modulation**: Increase ideation parameters (temperature=0.9, top_p=0.9) during divergent phases <!-- TODO: Verify optimal temperature settings with team -->
  * **Domain Crossing**: Deliberately pull analogies from unrelated fields (e.g., biology for software architecture, music theory for data structures)
  * **Quantity Over Quality**: Generate 5-10 diverse options before filtering, emphasizing fluency over immediate feasibility
  * **Progressive Randomness**: Start with mild perturbations, increase wildness if initial ideas remain conventional
  * **Meta-Prompting**: Explicitly request "unconventional solutions," "surprising approaches," or "what would [unexpected persona] do?"
  
* **Validation**:
  * Check: Were at least 3 distinctly different approaches generated?
  * Check: Does at least one solution involve cross-domain transfer?
  * Check: Are generated ideas genuinely novel (not just variations on a theme)?
  * Check: Was controlled randomness applied without losing problem relevance?
  * Check: Did the process avoid both extremes (too conventional vs. completely nonsensical)?

* **Examples**:
  * **Scenario**: Design a caching system
    - **Conventional**: "Implement LRU cache with Redis backend"
    - **Wildcard Applied**: "What if we treat cache like a **coral reef ecosystem**? Old data 'dies off' naturally, frequently accessed data 'grows' in coral-like structures, and cache regions have different 'temperatures' for different data types. **Music theory wildcard**: Use harmonic frequencies to determine cache placement - related data resonates at similar frequencies." <!-- TODO: Add performance metrics for unconventional approaches -->
  
  * **Scenario**: Optimize database queries
    - **Conventional**: "Add indexes and optimize JOIN order"
    - **Wildcard Applied**: "**Ant colony optimization**: Queries leave 'pheromone trails' - successful query paths get reinforced. **Wildcard from cooking**: Treat queries like recipe ingredients - pre-prep common 'ingredients' (subqueries) in advance. **Quantum inspiration**: Superposition queries that collapse to specific results only when observed."

* **Implementation Notes**:
  * Best used during divergence phase of divergence-convergence workflow
  * Should feed into structured evaluation rather than direct implementation
  * Maintain "internal_thought" vs "user_facing_response" separation
  * Combine with analogy-transfer for maximum creative synergy
  * Must be balanced by risk-checkpoint to filter dangerous wildcards

* **Changes**: Initial implementation v1.0.0. Establishes controlled randomness protocol based on lateral thinking research showing 25-50% creativity improvements.
