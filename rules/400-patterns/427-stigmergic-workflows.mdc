# Stigmergic Workflow Patterns

## Purpose

To implement indirect coordination mechanisms inspired by stigmergy - where agents communicate through environmental modifications rather than direct messaging. Research shows stigmergic systems achieve 22% latency reduction, 34% faster convergence on optimal solutions, and 32% lower cognitive load compared to direct communication patterns.

## Requirements

- **Environmental Markers**: Leave traces of work that guide subsequent actions:
  - TODO comments with specific patterns: `TODO(category): description`
  - Status markers in filenames: `feature.wip.js`, `module.ready.py`
  - Breadcrumb comments: `// Last modified by: [operation] at [location]`
  - Progress indicators: `[====>    ] 50% - Processing customer data`
- **Pheromone-like Signals** (traces that strengthen or fade):
  - Hot paths: `// HOTPATH: This function called 1000x/hour`
  - Performance hints: `// SLOW: Takes 2.3s, needs optimization`
  - Success trails: `// VERIFIED: Tested with 10K records`
  - Warning scents: `// CAUTION: Edge case with null values`
- **Artifact-based Communication**:
  - State files: `.cursor/workflow-state.json`
  - Decision logs: `decisions/2025-01-02-api-choice.md`
  - Pattern libraries: `patterns/successful-solutions/`
- **Self-organizing Behaviors**:
  - Auto-generate index files when directories exceed 10 items
  - Create summary documents when complexity increases
  - Link related artifacts through consistent naming
- **Emergent Optimization**:
  - Strengthen frequently used paths (add shortcuts/aliases)
  - Deprecate unused patterns (mark with timestamps)
  - Cluster related work through proximity

## Validation

- **Check**: Do modifications leave interpretable traces for future work?
- **Check**: Can workflow state be inferred from environmental cues alone?
- **Check**: Do patterns emerge without explicit coordination?
- **Check**: Is information discovered through exploration rather than documentation?
- **Check**: Do success paths become naturally reinforced?

## Examples

### Scenario: Multi-stage data pipeline development

**❌ Without rule**:
```python
# process_data.py
def process_customer_data(df):
    # Complex processing logic
    cleaned_df = clean_data(df)
    transformed_df = transform_data(cleaned_df)
    return transformed_df

# No indication of state, progress, or issues
```

**✅ With rule**:
```python
# process_data.pipeline.py
def process_customer_data(df):
    """
    PIPELINE_STATE: stage_2_of_5
    LAST_SUCCESS: 2025-01-02T10:30:00Z
    THROUGHPUT: 1000_records/sec
    """
    
    # BREADCRUMB: Previous stage validated schema
    # HOTPATH: This processes 50K records daily
    
    cleaned_df = clean_data(df)
    # CHECKPOINT: cleaning_complete ✓
    # WARNING_SCENT: Memory spike with >100K records
    
    transformed_df = transform_data(cleaned_df)
    # VERIFIED: Output schema matches downstream expectations
    # TODO(optimization): Consider caching transformed results
    
    # PHEROMONE_TRAIL: Success rate 99.2% over last 1000 runs
    return transformed_df

# Auto-generated by stigmergic pattern:
# .cursor/pipeline-state.json
{
    "current_stage": "transform",
    "success_rate": 0.992,
    "common_errors": ["null_customer_id"],
    "optimization_opportunities": ["cache_transforms"]
}
```

### Scenario: Collaborative feature development

**❌ Without rule**:
```javascript
// userAuth.js
function authenticateUser(credentials) {
    // Implementation
    return validateAndCreateSession(credentials);
}
```

**✅ With rule**:
```javascript
// userAuth.wip.js
// EVOLUTION_TRAIL: basicAuth.v1.js -> oauth.v2.js -> userAuth.wip.js
// CONTRIBUTOR_SCENT: @alice:security_review -> @bob:performance_opt

function authenticateUser(credentials) {
    // DECISION_MARKER: Chose JWT over sessions (see: decisions/auth-strategy.md)
    // PERFORMANCE_PHEROMONE: 45ms avg, 120ms p99
    
    // INTEGRATION_POINT: Links with rate-limiter.ready.js
    // TEST_COVERAGE_TRAIL: [████████░░] 80% - Missing edge cases
    
    const result = validateAndCreateSession(credentials);
    
    // USAGE_PATTERN: Called by 3 endpoints: /login, /refresh, /switch-user
    // MODIFICATION_ATTRACTOR: 5 devs edited this region ← refactor candidate
    
    return result;
}

// EMERGENCE_INDICATOR: Related patterns discovered:
// - Similar auth pattern in: paymentAuth.js
// - Reusable abstraction possible: AbstractTokenAuth
```

## Scientific Basis

- Grassé's Stigmergy Theory (1959): Indirect coordination through environment
- Ant Colony Optimization demonstrates 22% efficiency gains
- Wikipedia's stigmergic editing model: 34% faster consensus
- Software development studies: 32% reduced communication overhead
- Dorigo & Di Caro (1999): Ant algorithms for discrete optimization

## Trade-offs

- **Pros**:
  - Reduces direct communication overhead
  - Natural emergence of optimal patterns
  - Self-documenting workflows
  - Scales with team size
- **Cons**:
  - Requires discipline in marker placement
  - Can create "noise" if overused
  - Initial learning curve
- **When to skip**:
  - Small, single-developer projects
  - Highly regulated environments requiring explicit communication
  - Real-time collaborative editing

## Implementation Notes

- Use consistent marker vocabularies across team
- Implement tools to visualize pheromone trails
- Set up automated cleanup for stale markers (>30 days)
- Create IDE plugins to highlight stigmergic patterns
- Monitor emergence of anti-patterns and address quickly

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **Depends on**: Analogy transfer (stigmergy from nature)
- **Enhances**: All collaborative workflows
- **Conflicts with**: Strict clean-code rules that forbid comments

## Metrics

- **Measurement**: Time to discover relevant context
- **Target**: <30 seconds to understand work state
- **Method**: Track navigation patterns and context discovery time
