# Stigmergic Workflow Patterns

**Purpose**: Enable coordination through environmental traces rather than direct communication.

## Core Implementation

### Environmental Markers
- **Status comments**: `TODO(category): description` → classify work state
- **File naming**: `feature_WIP_username.tsx` → broadcast progress
- **Decision trails**: `// DECIDED: approach X because Y` → document rationale

### Adaptive Signals
- Performance hotspots accumulate profiling markers
- Success patterns strengthen through repetition
- Warning indicators emerge at failure points

### Artifact Communication
```yaml
# .workflow-state.yaml
current_phase: implementation
blockers: [api_design]
decisions:
  - choice: REST over GraphQL
    rationale: latency requirements
    evidence: benchmarks/api-comparison.json
```

### Self-Organization Rules
- Auto-index directories when files > 20
- Promote patterns used > 10x to recommended
- Cluster related work via naming proximity

## Validation
- Context discovery < 30 seconds
- State inferable from environment alone
- Conflict rate reduction measurable

## Integration
- **Version control**: Branch names as signals
- **CI/CD**: Pipelines respond to state markers
- **Scaling**: More valuable with team size
