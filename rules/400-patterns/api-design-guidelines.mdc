# api-design-guidelines

*Purpose*: Standardize service interfaces for consistency and usability.

- Version your API in the URL or headers (e.g. `/v1/users`).
- Use consistent pagination (`limit`/`offset` or cursors).
- Return structured error responses with codes and human messages.
- Document endpoints in OpenAPI/Swagger; keep docs in sync with code.
