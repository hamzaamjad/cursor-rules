# 80-20-prioritization-data-analytics.mdc

*   **Purpose**: Extend the core `80-20-prioritization.mdc` rule with specific metrics and frameworks for prioritizing data analytics tasks, ensuring focus on high-impact analysis, models, and data pipelines.

*   **Core Prioritization Metrics for Data Analytics**:

    1. **Revenue Impact**:
       - **Definition**: Potential to directly affect revenue streams through increased conversion, retention, or expansion
       - **Measurement**: Estimated revenue change (absolute $ and %)
       - **Example high-impact**: Customer churn prediction model that could recover $1.2M in annual recurring revenue (5% of ARR)
       - **Example low-impact**: Report formatting enhancement with no direct revenue connection

    2. **Process Efficiency**:
       - **Definition**: Time saved in recurring processes through automation or optimization
       - **Measurement**: Hours saved per week/month × affected user count × hourly cost
       - **Example high-impact**: Dashboard automation saving finance team (8 people) 5 hours each per week (2,000 hours/year)
       - **Example low-impact**: One-time analysis with no recurring time savings

    3. **Data Quality**:
       - **Definition**: Improvement in data accuracy, completeness, or timeliness
       - **Measurement**: Error rate reduction × business impact of errors
       - **Example high-impact**: Customer address validation that reduces failed deliveries by 8% ($350K annual savings)
       - **Example low-impact**: Fixing historical data inconsistencies in rarely-used fields

    4. **Scalability**:
       - **Definition**: Capacity to handle increasing data volumes or user loads without degradation
       - **Measurement**: Headroom created for growth × expected growth rate
       - **Example high-impact**: Query optimization reducing database load by 40% (enabling 2 years of projected growth)
       - **Example low-impact**: Optimizing a process with stable, low volume

*   **Decision Framework**:

    1. **Impact Assessment**:
       For each potential project or task, score on the four metrics above on a scale of 1-5:
       1. Minimal/no impact
       2. Minor impact
       3. Moderate impact
       4. Significant impact
       5. Transformational impact

    2. **Effort Estimation**:
       Estimate effort required on a scale of 1-5:
       1. Hours (trivial)
       2. Days (simple)
       3. Weeks (moderate)
       4. Months (complex)
       5. Quarters (major)

    3. **ROI Calculation**:
       Calculate impact-to-effort ratio:
       ```
       ROI Score = (Revenue Impact * 0.4 + Process Efficiency * 0.3 + Data Quality * 0.2 + Scalability * 0.1) / Effort
       ```

    4. **Decision Matrix**:
       Plot initiatives on a 2×2 matrix:
       - High Impact, Low Effort: Immediate Wins (Do First)
       - High Impact, High Effort: Strategic Projects (Plan Carefully)
       - Low Impact, Low Effort: Quick Wins (Do When Convenient)
       - Low Impact, High Effort: Avoid or Delegate

*   **Research Integration**:

    1. **Research Question Formulation**:
       Apply 80-20 principle to focus on highest-impact questions:

       ```
       # Weak Research Approach
       "Research data visualization libraries"

       # Strong 80-20 Research Approach
       "Identify the top 2 Python visualization libraries that would reduce dashboard development time by >40% while maintaining compatibility with our existing Pandas/SQL data pipeline"
       ```

    2. **Research Depth Calibration**:
       Match research depth to expected impact:

       | Expected Impact | Appropriate Research Depth |
       |----------------|----------------------------|
       | Transformational (5) | Deep research with multiple sources, expert consultation, and comprehensive analysis |
       | Significant (4) | Thorough research with multiple high-quality sources and structured analysis |
       | Moderate (3) | Focused research with 2-3 authoritative sources |
       | Minor (2) | Quick verification from single authoritative source |
       | Minimal (1) | Brief fact-checking only if critical |

    3. **Finding Synthesis**:
       Organize research findings using 80-20 principle:

       ```
       # Research Summary Structure

       ## Top 20% Findings (80% of Value)
       [3-5 key insights that directly answer the core question]

       ## Implementation Guidance (Practical 80/20)
       [The 20% of implementation steps that will deliver 80% of value]

       ## Limitations & Risks
       [The 20% of potential issues that represent 80% of the risk]
       ```

    4. **Citation Mapping for Traceability**:
       All research deliverables should include a 'Citation Mapping' appendix, listing each citation number and its corresponding URL. This ensures traceability, transparency, and ease of review for all referenced sources.

*   **Validation**:
    *   Check: Does the assessment explicitly score tasks against the four core metrics?
    *   Check: Is the effort estimation realistic and considering all implementation factors?
    *   Check: Is the ROI calculation transparent with weighted metrics appropriate to the context?
    *   Check: Are tasks correctly categorized in the decision matrix?
    *   Check: For research tasks, is research depth calibrated to expected impact?
    *   Check: Do research summaries highlight the vital few findings that deliver most value?

*   **Case Studies**:

    1. **Customer Churn Analysis**:
       
       **Initial Scope**: Analyze all customer data to identify churn factors
       
       **80-20 Application**:
       1. Focused on top 20% of customers representing 80% of revenue
       2. Identified that 3 specific behaviors predicted 75% of churn
       3. Developed targeted intervention for high-risk high-value customers
       
       **Result**: Reduced churn by 12% for high-value segment with 65% less analysis time than full-scope approach

    2. **Sales Performance Dashboard**:
       
       **Initial Scope**: Comprehensive dashboard with dozens of metrics
       
       **80-20 Application**:
       1. Interviewed sales leaders to identify 5 key metrics driving 80% of decisions
       2. Designed simplified dashboard focused on these metrics
       3. Added drill-down only for the critical dimensions
       
       **Result**: 90% adoption rate (vs. 30% for previous complex dashboard) and 4 hours/week saved per sales manager
