# ci-cd-testing-gatekeeper

*Purpose*: Enforce quality and reliability via CI/CD.

- Every PR must pass:
  - Linting (code style), formatting, and static typing checks.
  - Unit tests with â‰¥ 80% coverage; report coverage.
  - Security scan (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot alerts). Include guidelines for integrating new CI/CD tools and practices.
- Define checks in pipeline config (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).
- Require at least one approving review before merge. Regularly update test suites to cover new features and edge cases.
