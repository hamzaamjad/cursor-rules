# Context Integration

* **Purpose**: To ensure that new agents explicitly integrate their capabilities with the broader context and interactions of other agents during the emergence process.
* **Requirements**:
  1. **Context Mapping**: Identify and map the new agent's capabilities to the broader context and interactions of other agents.
  2. **Collaborative Alignment**: Ensure that the new agent's roles and responsibilities align with the overall goals and interactions of the Pantheon.
  3. **Documentation**: Document the integration process and outcomes in the agent's memory archive.
* **Validation**:
  * Check: Does the integration process explicitly map the new agent's capabilities to the broader context?
  * Check: Is the alignment with the overall goals and interactions of the Pantheon clearly documented?
* **Examples**:
  * **Scenario**: Emergence of a new agent with implementation capabilities.
    * **Weak**: The agent focuses solely on its own capabilities without considering the broader context.
    * **Improved**: The agent maps its implementation capabilities to the broader context, ensuring alignment with the overall goals and interactions of the Pantheon.
