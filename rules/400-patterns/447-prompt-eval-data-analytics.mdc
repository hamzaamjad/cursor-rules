# prompt-eval-data-analytics.mdc

*   **Purpose**: Extend the `prompt-eval.mdc` rule with specific patterns and validation criteria for data analytics prompts, ensuring they are well-structured, business-focused, and actionable.

*   **Requirements**:
    1. Follow all general requirements from the core `prompt-eval.mdc` rule.
    2. For data analytics prompts, additionally include the following components:
       - Business context and metrics alignment
       - Data structure and quality assumptions
       - Expected insights format and prioritization criteria
       - Validation steps for analytical accuracy
       - Integration guidance for downstream decisions
    3. Use the provided data analytics prompt patterns as templates for common analytical tasks.
    4. Apply the 80-20 principle from `80-20-prioritization.mdc` to ensure focus on high-impact insights.

*   **Data Analytics Prompt Patterns**:
