# test-driven-development

*Purpose*: Ensure high-quality, maintainable code via tests.

- Write tests before implementation (unit, integration).
- Aim for â‰¥ 90% coverage on new modules; report on each PR.
- Use descriptive test names (Given_When_Then style).
- Automate test runs in CI; fail builds on new test regressions.
