*Purpose*: Keep external libraries secure and reproducible.

- Pin all direct dependencies in lockfiles (`poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`).
- Periodically run vulnerability scans (Dependabot, Snyk).
- Review and approve major version bumps manually.
- Use semantic-versioning for internal libraries; document breaking changes.
