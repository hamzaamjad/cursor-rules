# [Rule Name in Title Case]

## Purpose

[Clear explanation of why this rule exists and what problem it solves. Should be 2-4 sentences that explain the motivation and expected outcome.]

## Requirements

- [Specific requirement 1 - use imperative mood]
- [Specific requirement 2 - be concrete and measurable]
- [Specific requirement 3 - avoid ambiguity]
- [Add more as needed, typically 3-7 requirements]

## Validation

- **Check**: [How to verify requirement 1 is met]
- **Check**: [How to verify requirement 2 is met]
- **Check**: [How to verify requirement 3 is met]
- [One validation check per requirement]

## Examples

### Scenario: [Describe a common use case]

**❌ Without rule**:
```[language]
# Example showing what NOT to do
# This should demonstrate the problem this rule prevents
```

**✅ With rule**:
```[language]
# Example showing the correct approach
# This should demonstrate the rule being followed
```

### Scenario: [Another use case if applicable]

**❌ Without rule**:
```[language]
# Another example of incorrect usage
```

**✅ With rule**:
```[language]
# Another example of correct usage
```
