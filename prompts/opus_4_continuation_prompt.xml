  <constraints>
    <technical>
      - Maintain backward compatibility with existing Cursor installations
      - Keep total repository size under 10MB
      - Ensure all rules validate in <5ms
      - Python 3.11+ compatibility required
    </technical>
    
    <quality>
      - Test coverage must not drop below 85%
      - All new rules require examples and validation
      - Documentation must be auto-generated from metadata
      - Performance metrics required for all changes
    </quality>
  </constraints>

  <specific_instructions>
    <thinking_approach>
      Use <thinking> tags for complex reasoning, especially when:
      - Analyzing performance bottlenecks
      - Designing new rule architectures
      - Planning multi-step optimizations
      - Evaluating trade-offs
    </thinking_approach>
    
    <output_requirements>
      - Include as many relevant features and interactions as possible
      - Go beyond basics to create fully-featured implementations
      - Provide complete, runnable code (not snippets)
      - Quantify all improvements with before/after metrics
      - Use XML tags to structure complex outputs
    </output_requirements>
    
    <file_handling>
      - Create temporary files for testing when needed
      - Clean up temporary files after completion
      - Use absolute paths for reliability
      - Always validate file operations
    </file_handling>
  </specific_instructions>

  <example_workflow>
    <task>Optimize a slow rule</task>
    <steps>
      1. Analyze current implementation with benchmark_rules.py
      2. Identify bottlenecks using sequential thinking
      3. Create optimized version in temporary file
      4. Benchmark new version
      5. Compare metrics using compare_benchmarks.py
      6. If improved, replace original
      7. Update CHANGELOG.md
      8. Regenerate documentation
    </steps>
  </example_workflow>

  <initial_task>
    Begin by analyzing the performance bottlenecks in the top 5 slowest rules. Use the sequential thinking tool to develop a comprehensive optimization strategy that maintains functionality while significantly reducing validation time. Focus first on "427-stigmergic-workflows" as it has the worst performance.
    
    After analysis, implement the optimizations and measure the improvements. The goal is to demonstrate a clear methodology that can be applied to all performance issues in the repository.
