# Decision-Making Framework Rules Summary

## Created Rules

### 1. IRA Framework (`110-ira-framework.mdc`)
**Purpose**: Systematic evidence-based decision making

**Key Features**:
- **Investigate**: Define decision triggers, audit evidence, identify gaps
- **Research**: Fill gaps with targeted methods (generative/evaluative)
- **Act**: Implement with embedded measurement and retrospectives

**Best For**:
- Complex problems requiring thorough analysis
- Situations with conflicting data sources
- Projects needing evidence-based validation

**Example Use Cases**:
- API performance investigation
- New feature validation
- Market research initiatives

### 2. OODA Loop (`111-ooda-loop.mdc`)
**Purpose**: Rapid iterative decision-making for competitive advantage

**Key Features**:
- **Observe**: Gather unfiltered real-time data
- **Orient**: Synthesize with mental models (destruction & creation)
- **Decide**: Generate falsifiable hypotheses quickly
- **Act**: Execute with clear feedback mechanisms

**Best For**:
- Time-critical decisions
- Competitive environments
- Incident response scenarios

**Example Use Cases**:
- Security incident response
- Real-time system optimization
- Market competition tactics

### 3. IRA-OODA Integration (`112-ira-ooda-integration.mdc`)
**Purpose**: Combine strategic depth with tactical agility

**Key Features**:
- Strategic layer (IRA) for quarterly planning
- Tactical layer (OODA) for daily operations
- Bidirectional knowledge flow between layers
- Synchronized but independent cycle times

**Best For**:
- Organizations needing both vision and adaptability
- Product development lifecycles
- Digital transformation initiatives

**Example Use Cases**:
- Product strategy with market responsiveness
- Enterprise architecture evolution
- Multi-timescale system management

## Integration with Existing Rules

### Dependencies
All three rules depend on:
- `000-core/001-philosophers-stone.mdc` - First principles thinking
- `100-cognitive/103-divergence-convergence.mdc` - Balanced exploration

### Synergies
- IRA provides depth to OODA's Orient phase
- OODA provides speed to IRA's Act phase
- Both frameworks enhance systematic problem-solving

## Usage Recommendations

1. **For Research-Heavy Projects**: Start with IRA framework
2. **For Time-Sensitive Situations**: Deploy OODA loops
3. **For Complex Organizations**: Use integrated approach

## Token Efficiency
- IRA Framework: 450 tokens
- OODA Loop: 425 tokens  
- Integration: 380 tokens
- All optimized for Cursor's token limits

## Next Steps
1. Test frameworks in real scenarios
2. Collect performance metrics
3. Refine based on usage patterns
4. Create specialized variants for specific domains
