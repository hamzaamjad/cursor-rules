# MCP Development Prioritization Framework

*Version: 1.0*
*Date: 2025-05-27*

## Purpose

Document the prioritization framework successfully used during Mercury MCP Server development, following 80/20 principles for maximum impact with minimal effort.

## High-Impact Prioritization Matrix

### 1. Low Effort + Extreme Impact (Do First) 🌟
- **Verify existing resources**: Test with real API before building elaborate mocks
- **Fix naming/configuration issues**: npm username verification, package naming
- **Leverage existing code**: Use mercury_client for integration testing
- **Simple documentation**: README badges, quick start guides

### 2. Low Effort + High Impact (Do Soon) 💪
- **Registry submissions**: Cline marketplace, official MCP list
- **Basic examples**: Hello world demonstrating all features
- **Configuration templates**: Claude Desktop config snippets
- **Social proof**: npm publication, GitHub repo

### 3. Medium Effort + High Impact (Plan For) 🔨
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit, integration, E2E tests
- **CI/CD setup**: GitHub Actions, automated publishing
- **Performance benchmarks**: Prove the 10x claim
- **Video demos**: Visual proof of speed advantage

### 4. Medium Effort + Medium Impact (Consider) 📈
- **Multiple transport options**: HTTP in addition to stdio
- **Extended examples**: Various use cases
- **Platform-specific integrations**: VS Code, Cursor

### 5. High Effort + Low Impact (Defer/Skip) ⚠️
- **GUI configuration tools**: Nice but not essential
- **Complex monitoring**: Overkill for initial release
- **Multi-language SDKs**: Stick to TypeScript initially

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Test with Real Systems First**: Don't mock what you can test directly
2. **Fix Blockers Immediately**: Username/scope issues prevented all progress
3. **Documentation as Marketing**: Good docs reduce support burden
4. **Community Integration Over Features**: Being in registries > having every feature

## Decision Heuristics

When facing a choice, ask:
1. Does this unblock other work? (Do it first)
2. Will users see/experience this directly? (Prioritize it)
3. Can this be automated later? (Document manual process first)
4. Is this required for launch? (If no, defer)

## Specific Examples from Mercury MCP

**High ROI Decisions**:
- Testing with real Mercury API instead of mocks (found issues early)
- Fixing npm scope immediately when publish failed
- Creating hello-world.ts covering all features in one file

**Avoided Time Sinks**:
- Didn't implement authentication beyond API keys
- Skipped complex error recovery scenarios
- Used existing mercury_client instead of reimplementing

## Retrospective Integration

This framework directly supports the 80-20-prioritization rule by:
- Providing concrete examples of high/low ROI activities
- Offering decision heuristics for future projects
- Documenting what actually worked in practice

## Usage

Reference this when starting new MCP servers or similar integration projects. Update based on outcomes from Mercury MCP Server community adoption.
