# Extended content for 108-cognitive-load-balancing

## Scientific Basis

- Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) demonstrates optimal learning at moderate load levels
- Medical diagnostics study (2024): 42% cognitive load reduction with AI assistance, 29% accuracy improvement
- Creative teams research: Peak performance at 0.45-0.62 CLT index
- Working memory capacity limits (Miller's 7±2) require active load management
- NASA Task Load Index (TLX) validated for human-AI interaction measurement

## Trade-offs

- **Pros**:
  - Prevents cognitive overload and decision fatigue
  - Maintains human engagement and skill development
  - Optimizes overall system performance
- **Cons**:
  - Adds complexity to interaction design
  - May slow down simple requests
- **When to skip**:
  - Emergency situations requiring all available processing
  - Expert users who explicitly request full complexity
  - Training scenarios designed to build capacity

## Implementation Notes

- Calculate CLT index using: (task_complexity × 0.4) + (presentation_complexity × 0.3) + (learning_required × 0.3)
- Use progressive disclosure for complex information
- Implement "cognitive load warnings" when approaching thresholds
- Maintain load history to identify patterns and optimize over time
- Consider individual differences - allow user-specific load preferences

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **Depends on**: Stepwise autonomy (for task breakdown)
- **Enhances**: All cognitive rules through load awareness
- **Conflicts with**: None, but modulates other rules' intensity

## Metrics

- **Measurement**: Average CLT index per session
- **Target**: 80% of interactions in 0.45-0.62 range
- **Method**: Calculate from response times, error rates, and task complexity
