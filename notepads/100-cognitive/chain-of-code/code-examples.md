# Chain of Code Implementation Examples

This notepad contains comprehensive code examples demonstrating the Chain of Code reasoning pattern across various problem domains. Each example includes problem statement, implementation, test cases, and verified output.

## Mathematical and Arithmetic Examples

### Complex Percentage Calculation with Multiple Conditions

The following example demonstrates how Chain of Code transforms ambiguous percentage calculations into precise, verifiable code. This pattern prevents common calculation errors and ensures consistent results across complex discount and tax scenarios.

```python
def calculate_final_price(base_price=1200, is_member=True, quantity=3):
    """
    Demonstrates price calculation with stacked discounts and tax.
    Each step is explicit and verifiable.
    """
    price = base_price
    discounts_applied = []
    
    # Step 1: Member discount
    if is_member:
        member_discount = price * 0.15
        price -= member_discount
        discounts_applied.append(f"Member 15%: -${member_discount:.2f}")
    
    # Step 2: Quantity discount
    if quantity >= 3:
        quantity_discount = price * 0.10
        price -= quantity_discount
        discounts_applied.append(f"Quantity 10%: -${quantity_discount:.2f}")
    
    # Step 3: Tax calculation
    tax_rate = 0.085
    tax_amount = price * tax_rate
    final_price = price + tax_amount
    
    # Verification output
    print(f"Base price: ${base_price:.2f}")
    for discount in discounts_applied:
        print(f"  {discount}")
    print(f"Subtotal: ${price:.2f}")
    print(f"Tax (8.5%): ${tax_amount:.2f}")
    print(f"FINAL: ${final_price:.2f}")
    
    return final_price

# Test cases to verify edge conditions
test_cases = [
    (1200, True, 3),    # All discounts apply
    (1200, True, 1),    # Only member discount
    (1200, False, 5),   # Only quantity discount
    (1200, False, 1),   # No discounts
]

for base, member, qty in test_cases:
    print(f"\nTest: member={member}, quantity={qty}")
    result = calculate_final_price(base, member, qty)
```

### Compound Interest with Variable Rates

This example shows how Chain of Code handles time-series calculations with changing parameters, ensuring accuracy through step-by-step verification.
